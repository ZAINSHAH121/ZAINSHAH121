💻 **Full-Stack Software Engineer** | Python | Java | .NET | WebSockets | Cloud Solutions | JavaScript | React | Next.js | Node.js | MERN Stack  

I’m a highly motivated and versatile Full-Stack Software Engineer with extensive experience in crafting scalable, secure, and high-performance web applications for both startups and enterprise-grade businesses. My passion lies in building modern, reliable, and efficient software systems that address real-world challenges.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from The Superior University, Lahore, and have successfully delivered multiple real-world projects — including AI-powered CRM systems, ERP solutions, and dynamic E-commerce platforms. My focus lies in crafting seamless user experiences, designing scalable architectures, and developing secure and efficient APIs that align with modern development standards.

I specialize in end-to-end software development — from intuitive frontend interfaces to robust backend logic, cloud deployment, real-time data visualization (WebSockets), and third-party integrations. Whether working on customer-facing products or enterprise-grade platforms, I apply a clean, scalable, and performance-first approach to every solution.

Currently, I am advancing my knowledge and leadership capabilities through a Master’s degree in Information Technology with Project Management at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS).

Outside of coding, I’m deeply passionate about keeping up with the latest tech innovations, improving software design patterns, and collaborating on transformative digital products.
